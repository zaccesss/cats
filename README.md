# Cats

Small practice repository used to learn Git and GitHub basics.

## What this repo is for

This repo is not a real project. It is a sandbox that I used to understand:

- How to create a Git repository
- How to track files with `git add` and `git commit`
- How to create and merge branches
- How to connect a local repo to GitHub and push changes

## Git workflow practised

Commands used in this repo include:

- `git init` to start a new repository in the `Cats` folder
- `git status` to check which files are untracked or modified
- `git add` to stage changes
- `git commit` to save a snapshot of the staged changes
- `git branch` and `git checkout` to create and switch branches
- `git merge` to bring changes from a feature branch back into the main branch
- `git remote add origin` and `git push -u origin main` to send the repo to GitHub

## File

- `cats.txt` simple text file that I edited several times to see how Git tracks changes over time
